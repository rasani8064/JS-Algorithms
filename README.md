#  Algorithm Design Techniques

## **Bruce Force:**

Simple and exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to find the best solution

Example: Linear Search

## **Greedy:**

Choose the Best Option at the current time, without any consideration for the future.

Example:
 1.  Dijkstra's Algorithm
 2.  Prim's Algorithm
 3.  Kruskal's Algorithm

## **Divide and Conquer**

Divide the Problem into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved and the partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution.

Example:
1.	Binary search
2.	Quick Sort
3.	Merge Sort
4.	Tower of Hanoi

## Dynamic Programming

Divide the Problem into smaller sub-problems. Break it down into smaller but Overlapping sub Problems. Store the result and reuse it for the same sub-problems.

this is Called **Memoization** and is a Optimize Technique that Improves the Time Complexity of Your Algorithm

Example:
1. Fibonacci numbers
2. Climbing Staircase

## Backtracking

Generate all possible solutions. check if the solution satisfies all the given constrains and only then you proceed with generating subsequent solutions. if the constraints are not satisfied, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution.

Example:

1. N-Queens Problem
