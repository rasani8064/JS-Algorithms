# Cartesian Product

**Problem**: Given two finite non-empty sets, find their Cartesian Product

In Mathematics, Specifically set theory, the Cartesian Product of two sets A and B, denoted A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a , b), where a is A and b is in B

    const A = [1, 2]
    const B = [3, 4]
    
    A x B = [ [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4] ]
    
    const C = [1, 2]
    const D = [3, 4, 5]
    
    C x D = [ [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5] ]
